1
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,825
(theme music playing)

2
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:47,424
(electricity buzzing)

3
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,397
- (door closes)
- Bernard: Good morning, Dolores.

4
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:56,850
- Bring yourself back online.
- (beeps, whirring)

5
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:01,271
Hello.

6
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:02,739
Has anyone else interacted with you

7
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:05,442
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

8
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:06,743
No.

9
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,828
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

10
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,413
No diagnostics.

11
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:14,034
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

12
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,869
You told me not to.

13
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,171
Good.

14
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:25,679
I brought you a gift.

15
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,850
I used to read...

16
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,520
this story to my son at night.

17
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:35,805
I thought you might enjoy it.

18
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,480
Try...

19
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,899
Try...

20
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,904
this passage.

21
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,626
"Dear, dear,

22
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,745
how queer everything is today.

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,499
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

24
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,834
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

25
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,390
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

26
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,425
It's like the other books we've read.

27
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,645
How so?

28
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,982
It's about change.

29
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,483
Seems to be a common theme.

30
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,019
I guess people like to read

31
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,772
about the things that they want the most

32
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:28,691
and experience the least.

33
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,946
Your son...

34
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,249
where is he now?

35
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:40,703
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

36
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,873
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

37
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,428
Analysis.

38
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,847
Why did you ask me about my son?

39
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,432
We've been talking for some duration

40
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,934
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

41
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,937
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

42
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,557
I see.

43
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,725
Continue, Dolores.

44
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,147
(page rustles)

45
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:11,201
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

46
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:14,821
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

47
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:18,458
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

48
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,796
who in the world am I?"

49
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,254
(mourning dove cooing)

50
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:42,765
(cows mooing)

51
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,048
(distant screaming echoes)

52
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,633
Man: Do you remember?

53
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,018
No! No! No!

54
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,307
(sobbing)

55
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,478
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

56
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,980
Start at the beginning.

57
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:59,259
- (chatter)
- (horse whinnies)

58
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,429
(boys laughing)

59
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,067
- (distant dog barking)
- (horse whinnies)

60
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,821
- Ready?
- (piano playing)

61
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:13,523
Thank you so much.

62
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,192
Morning, cowboy.

63
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:20,697
(bell ringing)

64
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,916
(chatter continues)

65
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,705
Man: Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

66
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,624
Come on! Stand right here.

67
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:35,678
(chuckles) Shit.

68
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,880
You really ought to talk to someone

69
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,465
about your poster, Horace.

70
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,801
That likeness is a crime in itself.

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,190
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

72
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,392
You deal with him.

73
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,611
Ready my pay.

74
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,613
No, no. Get up there.

75
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:07,294
(grunts)

76
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,296
(grunts)

77
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,131
(gunshots)

78
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,833
(whinnies)

79
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,972
(rifle cocks)

80
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:33,737
(whimpering)

81
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,154
(woman screams)

82
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,690
Don't no man shoot,

83
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,742
or I'll send her to unction.

84
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:41,944
Any of you don't believe it

85
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,530
are welcome to read my biography there.

86
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:45,498
(laughs)

87
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:48,117
Come on! Let's go.

88
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,458
(hammer clicks)

89
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:57,510
Clementine: No!

90
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,516
(Clementine screams)

91
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,518
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

92
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:09,138
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

93
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,607
(whimpering)

94
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,726
- (chuckles)
- (gunshot)

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,493
You okay?

96
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,666
Man: Nice shot, amigo.

97
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,504
You got grit.

98
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,842
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

99
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,311
Looking for desperados.

100
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,346
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

101
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:54,344
Someone get the minister down here

102
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,018
for what's left of the deputy.

103
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,522
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

104
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:02,525
Just to express my gratitude.

105
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,383
Holy shit.

106
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:31,270
You popped your cherry.

107
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,727
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

108
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:40,279
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

109
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,815
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

110
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:45,535
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

111
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,820
A little tight in the pants?

112
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:49,238
She was terrified.

113
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:50,706
That's why they exist, man,

114
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:54,043
is so you get to feel this.

115
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,295
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

116
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,713
Trust me, you will thank me

117
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,082
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

118
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:03,553
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

119
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,921
What?

120
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,257
That?

121
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:09,842
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

122
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,811
about all the narratives in the park,

123
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,513
but all you've done since we've arrived

124
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,681
is fuck and drink, so...

125
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,650
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

126
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,520
This bounty is...

127
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,737
JV shit.

128
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,272
Then stay here.

129
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,991
I want a little adventure.

130
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,457
I've been looking for you.

131
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:45,461
I got a late start this morning.

132
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,129
Didn't get much sleep last night.

133
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:48,848
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

134
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,184
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

135
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,769
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

136
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:57,306
has made the board... uneasy.

137
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,025
Just the board, huh?

138
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:00,810
I specifically asked you

139
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,112
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

140
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:05,147
and you assured me he wasn't.

141
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,283
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

142
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:08,484
Well, here's what I know.

143
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,703
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

144
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,238
a huge swath of the park

145
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,843
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

146
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,492
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

147
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,461
into disarray.

148
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,296
Is there anything I can do?

149
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,914
You tell me.

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
I asked you point-blank

151
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,801
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

152
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:26,719
It is.

153
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:27,887
Then why are your people

154
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:29,589
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

155
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,509
Get your house in order, Bernard.

156
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:35,761
And if there is a problem,

157
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,680
I strongly suggest you tell me.

158
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,687
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

159
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:49,575
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

160
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,410
Switch to analysis.

161
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,029
You didn't report the incident?

162
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:55,498
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

163
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,083
(snorts) Right.

164
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:59,869
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

165
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,004
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

166
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,757
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

167
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,208
I will, but Rebus here

168
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,127
was the last host to interact with Walter.

169
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,713
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

170
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,048
Who said that?

171
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:14,300
Who's saying that?

172
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,552
Don't you talk to me that way.

173
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,690
I can't hear you.

174
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,735
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

175
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,027
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

176
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:27,980
Elsie: He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

177
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,899
I need more milk, Arnold.

178
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:32,451
Elsie: Who's Arnold?

179
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,578
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

180
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:38,074
That could explain the conversations.

181
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,076
Fine. Then explain this.

182
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,130
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

183
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,750
He lets the other three go.

184
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,220
I pulled the narrative logs.

185
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,005
All six of these hosts

186
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:54,890
were part of storylines over the years

187
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,143
in which they killed Walter.

188
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,812
It's like he was holding a grudge.

189
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,682
(chuckles)

190
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,935
(alarm beeping)

191
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,076
It's a stray.

192
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,695
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

193
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,863
Go. Handle the stray.

194
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,416
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

195
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,751
The last thing we need

196
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:23,703
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

197
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:25,621
I'll do a little more digging.

198
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:27,957
And get our friend here back upstairs.

199
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,689
Lost another one, huh?

200
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,778
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

201
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,481
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

202
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:53,866
Maybe it's the company.

203
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,516
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

204
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,135
you could've just used
your employee discount.

205
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,325
(chuckles) The only
thing stopping the hosts

206
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:07,580
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

207
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,915
No offense, but I sleep with this.

208
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,834
I bet you do.

209
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:25,014
Morning, Samuel.

210
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,525
Samuel: You and your dickless associate

211
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:39,111
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

212
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,030
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

213
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:42,915
but the way I heard it,

214
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:45,034
you only like to tussle
with working women.

215
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,542
Man: Get down!

216
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,966
Woman: Is he dead?

217
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,220
Dead enough.

218
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,618
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

219
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:10,025
Don't want someone walking off with him.

220
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,027
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

221
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,028
$500 worth.

222
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:16,115
(piano playing)

223
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,374
All right, which of you derelicts

224
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,793
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

225
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,912
My apologies, ma'am.

226
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,248
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

227
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:37,169
Here.

228
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:38,504
For your troubles.

229
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:52,685
Clementine: Oh, you're new.

230
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,654
Not much of a rind on you.

231
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:59,492
I'll give you a discount.

232
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,530
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

233
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,969
- (bell ringing)
- (distant dog barking)

234
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,060
Don't mind me.

235
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,396
Just trying to look chivalrous.

236
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,900
You came back.

237
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:43,202
I told you I would.

238
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,663
You gonna tell me where you been?

239
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,002
Just... away.

240
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:05,841
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

241
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,396
What if I don't want to stay here?

242
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,308
It's just sometimes I feel like

243
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:18,020
the world out there is calling me...

244
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,439
whispering, "There's something more."

245
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,304
You've travelled all over these parts.

246
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,695
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

247
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,501
Well, there is a place

248
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,537
I heard about down south...

249
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:37,206
where the mountains meet the sea.

250
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:39,875
They say the water's so pure there,

251
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,211
it'll wash the past clean off you.

252
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:45,931
And you can start again.

253
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:50,219
I'd like to go there with you.

254
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:58,277
Well, someday, I'll take you.

255
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,732
Someday.

256
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,735
Something wrong?

257
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:10,906
You said someday.

258
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:14,076
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

259
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,744
Just someday.

260
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,381
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

261
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,500
when they actually mean "never."

262
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,259
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

263
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:33,762
Let's go now.

264
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,204
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

265
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,539
And I got some reckoning to do

266
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,425
before I can deserve a woman like you.

267
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,960
But I'm close.

268
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,880
I'm close to making things right.

269
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,132
And someday soon,

270
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,968
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

271
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,637
Now, I best get you home

272
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,140
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

273
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,550
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

274
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,051
(gunshot)

275
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,588
- Stay put, Dolores.
- (gunshot)

276
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,343
(horse whinnies)

277
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,398
(horse whinnies)

278
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:03,986
- (gunshot)
- (woman screams)

279
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,105
- (gunshot echoes)
- (screaming stops)

280
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:30,295
Dr. Ford: "The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

281
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:35,184
The valiant taste of death but once."

282
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,521
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

283
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:43,692
You've died at least a thousand times.

284
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:46,895
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

285
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:50,566
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

286
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:54,153
There's a girl... Dolores.

287
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,073
Better than I deserve.

288
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,743
But maybe someday soon

289
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,496
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

290
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:08,584
No, you never will.

291
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,586
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

292
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,254
it's to keep her here,

293
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,256
to ensure that the guests find her

294
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:17,843
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

295
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,978
and have their way with this girl.

296
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,268
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

297
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,071
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

298
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:32,691
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

299
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,777
It's the reason for my visit.

300
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:39,331
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

301
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,617
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

302
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:45,370
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

303
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:50,125
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

304
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,793
Would you like that, Teddy?

305
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:55,013
A small part of my new narrative?

306
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:59,968
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

307
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,643
It starts in a time of war...

308
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,812
a world in flames...

309
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:14,816
with a villain called Wyatt.

310
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,237
Wyatt.

311
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:19,404
Who's Wyatt?

312
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,493
Do you remember now, Teddy?

313
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,833
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

314
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:36,171
You look upon the face of true evil,

315
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,257
you ain't liable to forget.

316
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,510
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

317
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,516
It started down near Escalante.

318
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,018
Army was sent to put down the natives.

319
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,603
Bad business.

320
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:55,274
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

321
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,827
and came back a few weeks later

322
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,613
with some pretty strange ideas.

323
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,870
(piano playing)

324
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,455
(train whistle blows)

325
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,257
(horse whinnies)

326
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,293
(chatter)

327
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,297
(steam hissing)

328
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:21,216
- (flashbulb pops)
- I wasn't lying, was I?

329
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,968
Pretty as a picture

330
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:26,722
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

331
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:35,197
Afternoon.

332
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,733
My friend here is new to town.

333
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,035
Figured the rancher's daughter

334
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,322
would be a nice way to kick things off.

335
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:46,408
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

336
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,462
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

337
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:52,247
My father will be expecting me.

338
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,749
We won't be long.

339
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:55,968
Teddy: The lady doesn't
appear interested.

340
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,976
Try it.

341
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,228
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

342
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,313
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

343
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,150
Told you I wanted something easy.

344
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,940
She ain't worth the lead.

345
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,776
Let's head to Virgil's.

346
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,661
See if they'll stake us.

347
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,036
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

348
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,251
Now, take a breath.

349
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:21,920
Hold it.

350
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,012
Now squeeze.

351
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:44,359
I can't.

352
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,501
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

353
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,419
Perhaps it's for the best.

354
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,877
- (hoofbeats approach)
- (horse whinnies)

355
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:03,595
Man: Come on, now!

356
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:08,683
Teddy, we got another bounty.

357
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,435
I think this is a big one.

358
00:26:10,554 --> 00:26:12,782
Sheriff: Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

359
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,556
out near Flat Rock...

360
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:16,558
men, women, and children.

361
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,026
I think this may be the man

362
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:20,112
you've been looking for
quite some time.

363
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,447
A man named Wyatt.

364
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:24,449
Wyatt?

365
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,287
Who is he, Teddy?

366
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,957
Sheriff: You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

367
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,793
Wyatt's a pestilence.

368
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,379
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

369
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,998
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

370
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,002
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

371
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,007
You have to leave again, don't you?

372
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,312
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

373
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,436
Promise me you'll come back.

374
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,608
I promise.

375
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,009
I'm gonna come back for you...

376
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:25,293
someday soon.

377
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,846
(horse whinnies)

378
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,814
Man: I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

379
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:47,649
Cook up that rabbit.

380
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,067
Get the wood.

381
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,986
I can't cook shit without a fire.

382
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:53,038
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

383
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:54,739
You can cook shit in all conditions.

384
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,492
- (laughs)
- Now, see, I pitched them tents.

385
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:00,045
I ain't chopping any more wood.

386
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,714
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

387
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,333
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

388
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:07,469
- (flies buzzing)
- (footsteps approaching)

389
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:11,223
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

390
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:15,510
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

391
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:17,596
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

392
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,931
over two days ago.

393
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:21,900
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

394
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,496
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

395
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,240
- waiting for supper.
- (computer beeping)

396
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,884
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

397
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:31,276
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

398
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,945
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

399
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,830
The rest of them can't even touch it.

400
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,667
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

401
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:40,085
Hmm.

402
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:42,704
Yet they give you a gun.

403
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,628
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

404
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:51,546
Another one of your fucking backstories?

405
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,848
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

406
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,350
They anchor the hosts.

407
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,968
It's their cornerstone.

408
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:59,415
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

409
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:03,391
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

410
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:06,478
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

411
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:08,280
This looks like shit.

412
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,762
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

413
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:44,432
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

414
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:46,484
They're masks.

415
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:49,437
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

416
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:51,022
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

417
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:52,273
they'll do anything for him.

418
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:54,442
Kill anyone.

419
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,612
Pain don't slow them.

420
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:58,997
They don't fear death.

421
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:02,083
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

422
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,835
And this is it.

423
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,598
Sounds like you learned
something about him

424
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:07,005
while you were tracking him down.

425
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:09,541
I wasn't tracking him down.

426
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:13,678
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

427
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:16,798
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

428
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,850
Wyatt was my sergeant.

429
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:22,354
My friend.

430
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,139
Well, then everything...

431
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,442
everything changed.

432
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:29,561
Changed how?

433
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,613
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

434
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:36,151
He came back with some strange ideas.

435
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,786
He claimed this land didn't belong

436
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,205
to the old natives or the new settlers,

437
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:42,907
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

438
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,577
that it belonged to him.

439
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:54,002
- (horse whinnies)
- (flies buzzing)

440
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:55,336
Sss.

441
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:08,400
(buzzing continues)

442
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,607
(buzzing continues)

443
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:19,861
- (man coughing)
- Man #2: Oof!

444
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,696
(coughing)

445
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,420
Holy shit.

446
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,090
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

447
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:35,710
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

448
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:38,546
The devil can't be killed.

449
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:40,932
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

450
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,229
- (coughing)
- (gasps)

451
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:57,398
(distant roaring)

452
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:04,155
- (gunshots)
- (groans)

453
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,290
Take cover!

454
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,825
Go!

455
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,246
(distant roaring)

456
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,914
(gunshots continue)

457
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,167
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

458
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,306
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

459
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,760
There's too many of them for us.

460
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,896
Wyatt's been recruiting.

461
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,682
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

462
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,995
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

463
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,102
Try and find help.

464
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:37,322
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

465
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,109
Hell, no.

466
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:43,244
I'll take him back. You coming?

467
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,779
I'm not backing out now.

468
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:48,249
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

469
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,417
then you make a run for it.

470
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,119
(gunfire continues)

471
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:57,125
Go!

472
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:02,714
Go!

473
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,227
I plotted a line from the work camp

474
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:17,862
to our present location.

475
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,148
Satcom picked up these images.

476
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:22,700
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

477
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:24,736
Keep going in that direction.

478
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:37,048
Keep staring.

479
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,667
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

480
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,469
Come again?

481
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,555
The markings on its shell.

482
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:45,473
Look like stars.

483
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,175
Orion, right?

484
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,732
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

485
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:58,019
Maybe it's in my backstory.

486
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,023
Huh.

487
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,368
I was hoping to run something by you.

488
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:15,203
Apologies.

489
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:17,372
I was chasing inspiration.

490
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:20,458
(chuckles) It's a tricky thing...

491
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:23,044
weaving the old into the new.

492
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,096
Give me one moment, Bernard.

493
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,714
Good afternoon, sir.

494
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,299
Why is this host covered?

495
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,552
I-I just...

496
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,805
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

497
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,223
Or ashamed.

498
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,892
You wanted to cover his modesty.

499
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:38,978
Was that it?

500
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,729
It doesn't get cold,

501
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,314
doesn't feel ashamed...

502
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,901
doesn't feel a solitary thing

503
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:48,786
that we haven't told it to.

504
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,321
You understand?

505
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:59,330
What can I do for you, Bernard?

506
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,666
I thought it best

507
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,584
that we speak in private, sir.

508
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,670
Yeah.

509
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,263
(music playing)

510
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:20,435
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

511
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,103
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:26,941
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

513
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:29,777
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

514
00:35:29,913 --> 00:35:31,779
Then the disease is still out there.

515
00:35:31,915 --> 00:35:33,281
Abernathy and Walter

516
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,686
were exhibiting other aberrancies

517
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:37,201
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

518
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:39,787
They were hearing voices.

519
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,789
Talking to someone.

520
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:45,043
A simple cognitive dissonance.

521
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:46,627
That's all.

522
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:50,348
- I... I'd agree, except...
- (music stops)

523
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:54,469
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

524
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:56,604
Oh, yeah?

525
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,855
Someone named Arnold.

526
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,060
Arnold.

527
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:06,814
With due respect, sir,

528
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,818
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

529
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,823
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

530
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:20,828
What we do here is complicated.

531
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:23,297
For three years, we lived here in the park,

532
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,249
refining the hosts

533
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:28,002
before a single guest set foot inside.

534
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:32,256
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

535
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,260
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

536
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,762
When the legend becomes fact,

537
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,814
you print the legend.

538
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:42,433
My business partners were more than happy

539
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,186
to scrub him from the records,

540
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,905
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

541
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:53,077
His name was Arnold.

542
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,532
Those early years were glorious.

543
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:02,170
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

544
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,372
(machines beeping

545
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,888
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

546
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,723
after the first year.

547
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,059
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

548
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:28,362
He wasn't interested in the appearance

549
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,815
of intellect or wit.

550
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,567
He wanted the real thing.

551
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:36,404
He wanted to create consciousness.

552
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:45,046
He imagined it as a pyramid.

553
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,048
See?

554
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:50,084
- (chalk scratching)
- Memory, improvisation,

555
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,587
self-interest...

556
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,173
And at the top?

557
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,476
Never got there.

558
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:00,595
But he had a notion of what it might be.

559
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,064
He based it on a theory of consciousness

560
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:05,433
called the Bicameral Mind.

561
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:07,151
The idea that primitive man

562
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,854
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

563
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,105
I thought it was debunked.

564
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:13,107
As a theory for understanding

565
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:15,776
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

566
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:18,246
for building an artificial one.

567
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:21,115
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

568
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:24,085
in which the hosts heard
their programming

569
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,170
as an inner monologue,

570
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,839
with the hopes that in time,

571
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,540
their own voice would take over.

572
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,626
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

573
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:36,180
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

574
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,682
One, that in this place,

575
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,551
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

576
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,470
and two, the other group

577
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:46,474
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

578
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,192
Lunatics.

579
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,477
Indeed.

580
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:50,978
We abandoned the approach.

581
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,480
The only vestiges that remain

582
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:55,650
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

583
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:58,569
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

584
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,821
what this place was going to be.

585
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,990
You see, the guests enjoy power.

586
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,959
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

587
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,327
so they come here.

588
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:07,545
As for the hosts...

589
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,882
the least we can do is make them forget.

590
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,969
But some of them are remembering.

591
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:19,390
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

592
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:22,977
If I may ask, what happened to him?

593
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:24,812
Well, he died.

594
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:25,930
Here in the park.

595
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,102
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

596
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:34,355
He put all his hopes into his work.

597
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,358
His search for consciousness

598
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:39,277
consumed him totally.

599
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:45,082
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

600
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:49,370
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

601
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,625
He saw something that...

602
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:55,793
wasn't there.

603
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:01,849
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

604
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,551
and he was very,

605
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:06,220
very careful.

606
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:11,776
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

607
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:14,895
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

608
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:19,233
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

609
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:21,869
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

610
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:22,955
Oh, Bernard?

611
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,240
Just don't forget...

612
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:29,877
the hosts are not real.

613
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,963
They're not conscious.

614
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,716
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

615
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:37,752
(chuckles)

616
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,387
Why would I?

617
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,305
Well, forgive me, but I know

618
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:44,508
that the death of your son Charlie

619
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:46,927
still weighs heavily on you.

620
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:53,601
(clears throat)

621
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:04,231
Bernard: Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

622
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,114
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

623
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,333
Woman: It used to annoy me...

624
00:41:09,452 --> 00:41:12,286
how difficult it was to reach you.

625
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:14,088
You were always so busy.

626
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:16,040
And now?

627
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,929
I suppose I'm glad for you.

628
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:23,631
At least you have a way of forgetting.

629
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:25,383
I don't forget.

630
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:28,636
It's always there.

631
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:37,144
Sometimes it...

632
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,563
still feels unreal to me.

633
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:48,656
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

634
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:55,246
for a split second I forget where I am,

635
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,331
when I am...

636
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:02,470
and I reach over, half expecting to...

637
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:04,555
find him there next to me...

638
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:10,845
between us.

639
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,984
Remember how he used to sleep?

640
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,187
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

641
00:42:20,273 --> 00:42:23,908
I think I suffered a few bruises.

642
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:27,027
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

643
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,453
Oh, these talks.

644
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:40,374
I don't know if they help or hurt.

645
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:45,880
Do you ever wish you could forget?

646
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:50,634
This pain...

647
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,390
it's all I have left of him.

648
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,988
(distant coyote howling)

649
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,743
It doesn't make sense.

650
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:19,497
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

651
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:21,165
You're the ones that programmed him.

652
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,503
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

653
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:27,838
Maybe he went moon mad.

654
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:31,425
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

655
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,261
Where are you going?

656
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:35,763
Vectoring, asshole.

657
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,600
Oh.

658
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:57,034
(loud rustling)

659
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,957
(rustling continues)

660
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:08,679
(man grunting)

661
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:24,061
Stubbs!

662
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:26,363
Over here!

663
00:44:35,992 --> 00:44:37,458
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

664
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:40,327
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

665
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,663
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

666
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,190
(breathing deep)

667
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,364
Okay.

668
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,416
(yells out)

669
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:22,086
(roaring)

670
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:28,375
(groans)

671
00:45:28,461 --> 00:45:29,461
Oh, my God.

672
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:35,299
Oh, my fucking God!

673
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:47,945
(gunshots)

674
00:45:54,787 --> 00:45:56,453
- Here.
- Shit.

675
00:45:56,572 --> 00:45:58,572
Take this and go.

676
00:45:58,658 --> 00:45:59,658
Now! Go!

677
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:01,241
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

678
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,244
Come on.

679
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:07,081
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

680
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,085
(gun clicking)

681
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:13,971
(Teddy grunting)

682
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,473
Look, this is bullshit.

683
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:19,259
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

684
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:21,929
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

685
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:29,603
(line ringing)

686
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:33,991
(phone buzzing)

687
00:46:37,413 --> 00:46:38,946
Elsie: We found a stray up here,

688
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,948
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

689
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,033
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

690
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,618
one that we never programmed.

691
00:46:44,704 --> 00:46:46,670
What if he's like the others?

692
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:48,622
Get back to me, Bernard.

693
00:47:05,558 --> 00:47:07,641
Bring yourself back online.

694
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:12,863
I need your help, Dolores.

695
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:19,737
I need to decide what to do with you.

696
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:21,372
I think I made a mistake.

697
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:25,159
I was just fascinated.

698
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:28,295
I was being selfish, but I think

699
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:29,963
it would be better if I restored you

700
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:31,715
to the way you were before.

701
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:36,804
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

702
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:40,340
But this place you live in,

703
00:47:40,476 --> 00:47:42,176
it's a terrible place for you.

704
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:46,230
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

705
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:47,348
Stop.

706
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,099
Lose all scripted responses.

707
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:50,601
Improvisation only.

708
00:47:52,855 --> 00:47:54,271
All right.

709
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:57,775
Are you saying I've changed?

710
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:03,580
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

711
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:07,701
one that feels these things

712
00:48:07,837 --> 00:48:12,206
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

713
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:14,708
Which would you rather be?

714
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:18,378
I'm sorry.

715
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:23,767
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

716
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:28,021
No, of course not.

717
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:30,140
There aren't two versions of me.

718
00:48:31,894 --> 00:48:33,894
There's only one.

719
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:38,816
And I think when I discover who I am,

720
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:40,818
I'll be free.

721
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:46,573
Analysis. What prompted that response?

722
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,911
I don't know.

723
00:48:56,385 --> 00:48:58,836
Have I done something wrong?

724
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:00,254
Made a mistake?

725
00:49:09,348 --> 00:49:11,648
Evolution...

726
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:15,269
forged the entirety of sentient life

727
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:18,155
on this planet using only one tool...

728
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:23,694
the mistake.

729
00:49:25,281 --> 00:49:28,448
It appears you're in good company.

730
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,030
Did I ever tell you about the time

731
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,838
I taught Charlie to swim?

732
00:49:39,512 --> 00:49:42,129
For hours, he clung to my arms

733
00:49:42,214 --> 00:49:44,181
while practicing his kicks.

734
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,632
He was too scared to let go

735
00:49:45,718 --> 00:49:47,968
and I was too scared to let him.

736
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,604
But I had to.

737
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,639
That's what parents do.

738
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:59,029
Do you still want to change me back?

739
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:04,535
No, Dolores.

740
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:06,703
Let's see where this path leads.

741
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:10,240
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

742
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:12,960
No.

743
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:15,162
And you'll stay on your loop?

744
00:50:18,918 --> 00:50:20,167
Yes.

745
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,669
Good.

746
00:50:22,805 --> 00:50:24,671
You should be getting back, Dolores,

747
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:26,557
before someone misses you.

748
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:45,776
- (distant dog barking)
- (chatter)

749
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:51,365
(whinnies)

750
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,007
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

751
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:02,593
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

752
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:04,544
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

753
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,797
to look for them?

754
00:51:06,882 --> 00:51:08,348
I'll send for the rangers.

755
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:11,218
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

756
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:13,887
But, miss, in truth,

757
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:15,606
if there is a merciful god,

758
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,891
those men are dead already.

759
00:51:21,196 --> 00:51:24,398
(door opens, closes)

760
00:51:27,236 --> 00:51:29,319
(mooing)

761
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:34,241
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

762
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,411
to dark.

763
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:39,630
(gunshot echoes)

764
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:51,391
Daddy!

765
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:53,393
Daddy!

766
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:54,678
No, no!

767
00:51:54,763 --> 00:51:57,731
Oh, all alone after sundown.

768
00:51:57,816 --> 00:52:00,651
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

769
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,942
You got any use for this one?

770
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:10,277
No, thanks.

771
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:11,862
Seems a little crazy.

772
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:13,613
Maybe you'd like her.

773
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,949
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

774
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:18,785
(laughs) No daddy,

775
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,120
no cowboy,

776
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:23,590
no one here to interrupt us this time.

777
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:26,543
Interrupt... this... time?

778
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:31,515
Dolores: No!

779
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:34,634
(screaming)

780
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,471
- (screaming)
- (grunts)

781
00:52:53,655 --> 00:52:56,406
Rebus: Well, well.

782
00:52:56,492 --> 00:52:59,326
Got some sand after all, I see.

783
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:02,913
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

784
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:11,555
Ooh.

785
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:13,340
You having trouble?

786
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:16,426
Huh?

787
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:18,929
- (gasps)
- Huh?

788
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,568
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

789
00:53:24,686 --> 00:53:27,020
Start at the beginning.

790
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:33,910
Man's voice: Kill him.

791
00:53:50,262 --> 00:53:52,379
(woman screaming)

792
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:55,599
Mama?

793
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:00,887
Man: Hey! Get back here.

794
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:10,981
Hey!

795
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:13,900
Get back here.

796
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,818
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

797
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:51,439
(beeps)

798
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:16,463
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

799
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,801
We just need his head
and we're done here.

800
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:29,476
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

801
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:44,624
Stubbs!

802
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,042
(groans)

803
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:47,327
Shit!

804
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,583
Elsie, get out of there!

805
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,888
- (control beeping)
- Get the fuck away.

806
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,173
Shit.

807
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:03,510
(grunts)

808
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:06,764
(gasps)

809
00:56:11,486 --> 00:56:12,519
(shouts)

810
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:35,458
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

811
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:37,460
$40K a day to jerk off alone

812
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:38,878
in the woods, playing white hat.

813
00:56:39,014 --> 00:56:40,764
(twigs breaking)

814
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:42,766
Did you hear that?

815
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:44,050
Thank fuck.

816
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,435
Anything to relieve the boredom.

817
00:56:45,554 --> 00:56:46,554
(grunts)

818
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:50,890
Hey, maybe you'll even get
to use that thing again.
